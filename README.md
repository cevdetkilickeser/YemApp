# Food Delivery App
Food Delivery App is an Android application developed using Kotlin and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. The project utilizes Hilt for dependency injection, Retrofit with coroutines for network requests, Room for local data storage, Glide for image loading, and Firebase Authentication for user authentication.

## The Goal of the Project
Developing projects using architecture, technologies and libraries that I learned during the course.

## Architecture
The application architecture is based on the MVVM pattern, which separates the data presentation logic (Views or UI) from the core business logic of the application.

## Libraries
**- Retrofit ->** A type-safe HTTP client for Android and the JVM. <br/>
**- Coroutines ->** Library support for Kotlin coroutines. <br/>
**- Room ->** Persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access. <br/>
**- Glide ->** A fast and efficient open-source media management and image loading framework. <br/>
**- Firebase ->**  Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users. Firebase Firestore is a NoSQL cloud database that allows you to store and sync data across devices in real-time. Firebase Storage is a powerful, simple, and cost-effective object storage service for storing and serving user-generated content.
